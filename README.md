# 🚁 DelyvAir's Shopping Cart 🛒

Welcome to the Clean Code + Debugging workshop! In this exercise, you'll work on a **basic shopping cart application** built using **Svelte + TypeScript**.

The goal is not just to fix bugs, but to **identify bad code practices**, **improve readability**, and **write cleaner, more maintainable code**.

PS: If you're new to Svelte, [intro to svelte docs](./src/docs/intro_to_svelte.md) doc will get you coding svelte in no time!

## 🧠 Scenario

You're joining a small frontend team at an E-Commerce startup (DelyvAir) that does deliveries via drone. A developer built the cart UI quickly, however there are users complaining of some things not working properly. 

It has:

- 🐞 Bugs
- 😵 Messy structure

Your job is to:
1. **Find and fix at least 2 bugs**.
2. **Refactor** the code to make it more readable, predictable, and clean.

Please take the time to investigate and find the bugs.

⚠️ Disclaimer: If you honestly searched and didn't find any bugs, refer to [known Bugs](./src/docs/known_bugs.md) to know which things are currently buggy. (Do not take a look prior to searching yourself)

   ```bash
    npm install
